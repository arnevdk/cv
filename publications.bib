    abstract = {This work constructs an algorithm to transcribe event-related potentials (ERPs)
recorded by EEG in response to a sequence of single-trial stimuli, to a sequence of
symbols. Each symbol represents a distinct category of ERP shapes. The resulting
sequence-of-symbols representation is a noise-reduced format for sequences of ERPs
and can be utilized by pattern mining algorithms to analyze sequential and contextual
structure in sequences of ERPs. This information would otherwise be lost when
averaging over multiple EEG trials, which is currently the most popular method for
reducing noise in ERPs. The algorithm is developed using available EEG recordings
from N -back experiments, a visual paradigm which produces a sequence of ERPs.
In order to cope with the remarkably high signal-to-noise ratio, spatio-temporal
beamforming is applied as a linear filter to extract noise-reduced features from
single-trial ERPs. This work extends the spatio-temporal beamformer to the spatio-
temporal multi-component beamformer to capture more information from each ERP.
Two multi-component beamforming approaches are developed. The first method is
based on time-window truncated activation patterns, while the second method refines
the component activation patterns to isolate specific ERP components. Subsequently,
features extracted by the multi-component-beamformer are categorized in groups,
which in turn can be represented by a transcribed symbol, using k-medoids clustering.
The methods are validated by testing the informativeness of extracted features in
several classification tasks and by inspecting the representative ERPs for each symbol,
obtained by averaging over all trials in the symbolâ€™s cluster.
Results show that the multi-component beamformer has the potential to improve
state-of-the-art performance in target/non-target classification for ERP based Brain-
Computer Interface paradigms. Visual inspection of symbol representatives shows
apparent differences in ERP shape for each cluster, indicating that the algorithm can
capture different types of ERPs in different symbols. However, this method is still
hindered in its performance and applicability by the large inter-subject variability of
ERPS, as well as the inherently high noise levels present in single-trial ERPs.},
